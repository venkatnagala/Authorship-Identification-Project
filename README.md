The Authorship Identification project identifies the author of a given text using machine learning techniques such as K-NN or SVM. The user can select the machine learning technique from the user interface GUI and the author of a given text is identified after the training machine learning algorithm on the corpus of texts written by the author. The machine learning model training includes works of 10 different authors. During testing a text is randomly selected that is written by one of the author's that is NOT part of the training texts. The machine learning model  correctly identifies the author.

Safety Implications

I have experience identifying unique signatures in generated text. In a safety context, this is essential for detecting deceptive alignment (where a model might hide its true intent behind a specific 'persona') or identifying subliminal signals hidden in model outputs.
